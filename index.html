        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>HTML</b>(Hypertext Markup Language) is made up of elements that perform distinct roles</li>
          <li><b>HTML</b> is the Frame work of an Appilcation</li>
          <li><b>HTML</b> elements are case-sensitive</li>
          <li><b>Metadata</b> is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users</li>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element is a container for <b>metadata</b></li>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element represents the visible content shown to the users</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>CSS</b>(Cascading Style Sheets) programming language to style a application</li>
          <li><b>Inline CSS</b>styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only,useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change</li>
          <li><b>Internal Style Sheet</b>contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file, rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements</li>
          <li><b>External Style Sheet</b> is preferred in most cases because it allows devs to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li><b>Class attributes</b> allow us to share a <b>CSS rule</b> to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</li>

          <li><b>Git</b> a version control system thats lets you manage and keep track of each ver. of your project</li>
          <li><b>Git commands</b> always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code, can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit</li>
